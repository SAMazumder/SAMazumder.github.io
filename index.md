Former mathematician(?). B.Sc. in Mathematics and M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from Toronto Metropolitan University.

In a past life, I was a biochemist with a focus on plant physiology at U of T. 

Slowly trying to make the world a better place. 

Currently based in several cities in Canada. 

I like lifting heavy objects up above my head.  

I drink copious amounts of coffee. 

You can find my short CV [here](/assets/SAMazumderWeb.pdf).

My cats are cute.
