<img src="/assets/me.jpg" width="200" height="200"> I'm an MSc. Applied Mathematics candidate at Ryerson University.

When I have time, I like repeatedly picking heavy objects up above my head, then allowing them to fall. 

I drink copious amounts of coffee. 

You can find my short CV [here](SAMazumderResume.pdf)

My cats are cute.
