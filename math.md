Math is pretty cool.

I started and finished(?) my math career at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University). In general, my mathematical and research interests were in Functional Analysis, Stochastic Processes and Measure/Probability Theory. I also have a passing interest in Category Theory.

## Some Work

Here are some notes I have made:

My masters thesis will be available here soon.

[Some basic functional analysis](/assets/notes.pdf). I will at some point finish them.

[Seminar F21](/assets/Non_Cooperative_Games.pdf). A seminar presenting "Non-Cooperative Games" by John Nash.

[Seminar F20](/assets/BG_distribution_of_money.pdf). A seminar presenting, "\[A\] Rigorous proof of the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of money on connected graphs by Nicolas Lanchier.

[Some basic facts about mod](/assets/EqCmod.pdf). A note provided to my students in Discrete Math I.

[The Lagrange Form of the Interpolating Polynomial](/assets/LagrangePoly.pdf). A note provided to my students in Numerical Analysis.

[A GLM model](/assets/EconM.pdf). A capstone assignment for an econometrics course.


You can find my undergraduate thesis [here](/assets/thesis.pdf).

I make no claims to the correctness of the above.
