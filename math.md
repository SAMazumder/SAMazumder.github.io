Math is pretty cool.

I'm in the process of writing masters thesis under the supervision of Dr. Foivos Xanthos at Ryerson University. In general, my mathematical and research interests lie mainly in Functional Analysis, Stochastic Processes and Probability. I also have passing interest in Category Theory for its beauty.

## Some Notes

Here are some notes I have made:

[Some basic functional analysis](/assets/notes.pdf). I will at some point finish them.

[Some basic facts about mod](/assets/EqCmod.pdf). A note I provided to my students in Discrete Math I.

[A Note on the Lagrange Form of the Interpolating Polynomial](/assets/LagrangePoly.pdf). A note provided to my students in Numerical Analysis.

[A GLM model](/assets/EconM.pdf). A capstone assignment for an econometrics course.


You can find my undergraduate thesis [here](/assets/thesis.pdf).

I make no claims to the correctness of the above.
