Math is pretty cool.

I'm in the process of writing masters thesis under the supervision of Dr. Foivos Xanthos at Ryerson University. In general, my mathematical and research interests lie in Functional Analysis, Stochastic Processes and Probability. I also have passing interest in Category Theory for its beauty.

## Some Work

Here are some notes I have made:

[Some basic functional analysis](/assets/notes.pdf). I will at some point finish them.

[Seminar F21](/assets/Non_Cooperative_Games.pdf). A seminar presenting "Non-Cooperative Games" by John Nash.

[Seminar F20](/assets/BG_distribution_of_money.pdf). A seminar presenting, "\[A\] Rigorous proof of the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of money on connected graphs by Nicolas Lanchier.

[Some basic facts about mod](/assets/EqCmod.pdf). A note I provided to my students in Discrete Math I.

[The Lagrange Form of the Interpolating Polynomial](/assets/LagrangePoly.pdf). A note provided to my students in Numerical Analysis.

[A GLM model](/assets/EconM.pdf). A capstone assignment for an econometrics course.


You can find my undergraduate thesis [here](/assets/thesis.pdf).

I make no claims to the correctness of the above.
